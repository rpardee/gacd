This repository contains the raw data, processing script, and codebook for the output datasets for the above-listed coursera course.

All data processing is contained in the single R script, run_analysis.R.  To run this:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Edit line 29 of run_analysis.R to point it to the root of your cloned repository (e.g., the location of run_analysis.R).
3. Create a new 'submit' subdirectory under that root.
4. Submit run_analysis.R to R either via command-line or using the source() command at an R prompt.

You should thereafter fine the two derived datafiles in the submit subdirectory.
